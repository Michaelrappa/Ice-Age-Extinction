 For a very long time, scientists and archeologists have known that there existed megafauna in the same period that human expansion was occurring. The estimate of the following extinction leads to a conclusion that about 99% of the megafauna are completely done away with. The extinction of these megafauna is still a topic of contention today. By comparing the number of dated bones and climate change, it is realized that megafaunal species like the horse and mammoth experienced boom and bust cycles during the ice age as they tried to survive rapid changes in climate. Their extinction occurred at the end of the ice age because the rising sea level dispersed to different routes and spreading peat degraded the quality of range (Lanoë, et al. 2019).
Some archaeologists believe that human activities contributed to the cause of the extinction. Activities such as overhunting of these species, human-driven habitat changes, and overfishing have acted to push most of the species to the collapse. Geologists suggest that we are in the new phase in the history of the earth known as Anthropocene. Towards the close of Pleistocene, one of the extinction occurred which was realized a few tens of thousands years ago. The period is also known as the megafaunal extinction since it cleared many of the species from the large group of animals (Mann, et al. 2019). The cause of this extinction however, remains a continuous debate among scientists. 
The hypotheses
The first argument as to the cause of this extinction is that it was as a result of climate change. Here, the focus is on temperatures and precipitation. The climate change argument points out that our planet started changing and developing from the last ice age just at the same time that the extinction began (Wang, et al. 2017). At this period, the global temperature is said to have increased, a change which is believed to have seriously affected the larger animals to a greater extent than it affected smaller animals. The reason for this is because larger animals cannot loose heat at a sufficient rate, which does not affect smaller animals as much. In addition, the climate during this time was recorded to be fluctuating from very wet conditions to very dry ones in many areas. The fluctuation in climate exacerbated the megafaunal extinctions. Many mammals found it difficult to adapt to such changing climate because they possessed thick fur coats. 
The second argument by scientists and archaeologists is in reference to the human fault of the extinction of ice age megafauna known as the hunting hypothesis. The hunting hypotheses notes that humans lived together with megafauna, and even adapted to hunting them. Evidence however, showed that the extinction in places like Eurasia occurred when hunting could not be the cause. These discrepancies led to the beginning of the disagreement over what caused the megafaunal extinction. Currently, some researchers have concluded that overhunting is the main reason for the megafaunal extinctions in America and Australia known as the “overkill” theory. The overhunting argument holds water as the cause of the extinctions in areas like New Zealand and Australia in which researchers still debate that the climate in these areas had an affect towards extinction. The argument follows that the species living at these times were already arid adapted and would not have been affected by change in temperature that much.
The overkill theory shows evidence that the migration of humans into the animal inhabited regions allowed them to hunt easily (Yin, Chenyang and Di-Ying 2018). The indigenous animals had not seen human beings before, and thus they were susceptible to the hunting tactics of man. In addition, many of the environments were arid and hot, and because the hunters had the skills to make fires, humans burned away large regions of the animal habitat as a tool for hunting. However, the overhunting argument cannot be seen as the main cause in other parts of the world in relation to the extinction of the megafauna. Regardless of human hunting, significant climate changes were happening during the same time that humans were making their entry into the continents, which made it difficult to determine the reason that brought up the greatest change in the survival conditions for the megafauna.
Thirdly, there is a disease theory suggesting that an extreme disease killed off the megafauna. The disease would have affected the larger mammals in a more destructive way because of the slower reproduction rate of larger mammals compared to smaller ones. However, for a disease to have wiped out so many animal species it would have had to have been able to live outside the host and it must have been highly contagious and lethal. Although this has been theorized, the disease outbreak hypotheses also have no much evidence to support it.
Field and laboratory methods 
The total population of extinct megafauna could be calculated for each area to account for naturally occurring species distributed area of each country. Extinction can be expressed as the total extinct and extant species that were supposed to do away with the effects of human driven extinctions and range contractions occurring in the previous years. 
Climate change was measured in two ways; climate change rate, and the rate of displacement of the mean annual temperature and annual precipitation by spatial gradient. Species would probably respond to local environments rather than global changes. Scale topography affects climate change velocities variations. Velocity range determined for each region showed the median velocity range per country, temperature and precipitation per year. Suggesting that, the velocity variation within each country was small and not problematic.
Test of hypotheses
Climate change, hominin paleo bibliography and hominin- climate combination models can be constructed and compared to examine which predictor variables described the recorded regional ratios. As velocity was calculated, using climate change anomaly, variables are not included in the same hominin-climate combination model. As per the hominin model, all combinations explored. The combination of hominin paleo biography and optimal description was found to be summing up the three regions together referred to as archaic combination. The combined model also performed better than including modern human arrival period. 
Construction of the GMLs using an arcsine square root transformation was found out to be appropriate because the nature of the binomial data was not a factor of sample collection and a fifty percent reduction was allowed. AIC was used to choose the best climate change, hominin paleo biogeography and hominin climate combined models. In the above procedure, a GLM was constructed by a quasi-family, logit link and variance to prepare the non-normal distribution of proportion data. The results were found to be consistent. To assess the rate of spatial autocorrelation, a calculation of correlograms of GLM model residuals was used. Spatial autoregressive model of the error type was structured to ascertain for SAC in the multivariate hominin-climate model and was compared to the GLM using the arcsine square root. The SAR models were implemented in the R-package. The spatial weights matrix was described by connecting each country to its four neighboring countries. The SAR model removed models residual SAC (electronic supplementary material) and analysis were performed. (Mann et al., 2019).
A conservative literature review provided evidence of continentally extinct megafauna species. Temperature and precipitation change best describe the reasons for the extinction pattern. Human paleo biogeography was included as a categorical variable with three levels, homo origin, combined archaic and homo sapiens. A full model was attained from the predictors of the best climate and human models with an interaction between human paleo biography and two climate predictors.
Conclusion
Although some claim that during the period of ice age extinctions, humans were the cause of widespread extinctions. However, humans at this time did not have the ability to kill megafauna in the large numbers that would have been required to drive them to extinction. Moreover, in some areas humans would not have been able to kill off species of megafauna because thy didn’t inhabit such areas. The greatest critique of the overkill hypotheses is that there is not yet enough evidence to prove that humans bear the blame for the ice age extinctions. Nevertheless, just because there is not strong enough evidence for the overkill hypotheses, that does not mean it is a lie. In short, the main cause of extinction of the megafauna species is still a debatable dilemma and is likely a combination of factors with the driving cause being climate change and not overhunting, which would have been a subordinate contributing factor to the extinctions that occurred.
